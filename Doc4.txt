Whatever number of migrants you think there are today all over the world, I bet you’re wrong. According to the UN, the number of estimated migrants in 2020 was 281 million people, 35 million of which were children under 18. This is a 180 million increase from their numbers in 1990 in just 30 years. Imagine how many they are in 2022, and how many they will be in a few years. The Russian Federation defines migration as follows: "movement of people for various reasons across the borders of certain territorial entities for the purpose of permanent or temporary change of place of residence"(Sergievskaya, 2021). While it is not a new phenomena; migration has been around since civilization, it has become an increasingly common phenomena, and its increasing presence has made many people consider migrating because if others could make it, why couldn’t they? Some migrate for better working conditions, better healthcare and education, or because of environmental disasters (Sergievskaya, 2021). The reasons differ, but the effects of migration remain vastly the same for arabs/muslims migrating to non-arab/muslim countries. It is a significant issue that presents itself in our age and its consequences: mental exhaustion because of othering, the loss of cultural connections, the weight of trying to raise children in a culture you don’t want them to embrace but which they need to, are no mere issues. While the grass may seem greener on the other side, migration is not the right decision for families.
