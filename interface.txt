The software starts by showing the user a bar where he can paste the path of the files to be checked. Right next to the bar are two check boxes thatgive the user the choiceof which matching algorithim he will use, whether it will be one of them or both of them. The path shpuld look like this "C:\Users\Username\...\Simple-Plagiarism-Detector-QT-main (2).zip\Simple-Plagiarism-Detector-QT-main\"

 After pasting the path the user should press on the "Detect Plagiarism" button which will open a new screen. The screen wil display the file that is being checked for plagiarism and will highlight all the plagiarized sections in red. On the top right there is  bar that shows a percentage of how much the text is plagiarized, and right next to it there is a reset button that takes the user back to the first screen in order to change the algorithim used.
