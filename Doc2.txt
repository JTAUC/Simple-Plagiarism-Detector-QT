A college student named Julia always found it difficult to concentrate during lectures. She often found herself doodling in the margins of her notebooks and on the corners of her worksheets. Julia's teachers were always scolding her for doodling, saying that it was a distraction from learning. One day, Julia stumbled upon an article that caught her attention. It was about a study that showed how doodling can actually enhance learning. She was intrigued and decided to do some more research on the topic.

Julia found that doodling can improve concentration, comprehension, and retention of information. It provides a distraction-free outlet for the mind to wander and can help to provide a visual representation of the lecture material. Armed with this new knowledge, Julia decided to try it out for herself. The next day, Julia attended her biology lecture and took out a blank sheet of paper and a pen. She started to doodle while listening to the lecture, allowing her mind to wander and her pen to flow freely. She found that she was able to concentrate better on the lecture and that she was able to remember more of the information. At the end of the lecture, Julia was surprised to find that she had retained much more information than usual. She was curious if her experience was unique, so she decided to conduct her own research on the topic.
