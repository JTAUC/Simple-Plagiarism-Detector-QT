Choosing a career is an important decision for both adults and children. It can help you find financial security and greatly affect your daily life. However, choosing a career path can be difficult for people young enough to learn on the job. Therefore, children should never have to make this decision on their own.

Choosing a career is an essential part of becoming an adult- respected member of the society and making a living. Education and training are essential parts of any serious career planning. This is especially true for skilled jobs that require extensive training. Choosing a career path early in life helps you plan your education and prepares you for success in your chosen field. Plus, it helps you identify any weaknesses in your abilities that need fixing before you take any serious action in your career. This way, you'll have the best possible chance of success and happiness in your daily life.
Another reason why children shouldn't choose a career is that it helps them establish their identity as a person. 

Choosing a profession helps people form positive or negative beliefs about themselves. For example, if you choose to be a doctor, this shows you believe you're intelligent enough to fulfill this role effectively. On the other hand, choosing poorly can negatively affect your self-confidence and cause you to waste valuable resources managing your life around somebody else's. Therefore, it's crucial for children to make this decision without adult influence weighing on their shoulders.

It's also important to give children more control over their careers by not forcing them into any specific path. Professionals are often referred to as 'hobbyists' because they choose their own paths within their field of work. This makes them flexible and able to quickly learn new skills within their area of expertise. It's also much easier to find good job opportunities for skilled hobbyists due to the high demand for their services. Additionally, many hobbyists are able to start businesses based on their interests; this makes them very wealthy individuals. Therefore, children should never feel forced into following a certain path without any motivation or reason behind it.

Instead of choosing a specific career path early on, it's best to choose an area of interest and pursue it further with age and experience. Many people pick up a hobby at a young age and turn it into a lucrative business in later life- this is sometimes referred as 'side hustling' or 'earning while learning.' Essentially, following an interest leads to the same result as choosing a specific career path; you're choosing an area of interest you want to pursue further with age and experience. Plus, side hustles are great ways to supplement your income while you pursue a more serious occupation within your field of expertise.
